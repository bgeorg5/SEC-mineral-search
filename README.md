# SEC-mineral-search
This is the test code for a tool to search SEC filings using sec-api.io.
This is incomplete and needs some improvements/ revising.


(1)
You need to create a file called '.env' . This is where we define the API key.
It's contents should be one line, formatted as such: 

SEC_API_KEY="..."

where "..." is just your API key.


(2)
You can either run an 'npm install' commands for any missing requirements 
Or
unzip the compressed_node_modules folder.
